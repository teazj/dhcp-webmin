# dhcp-webmin
Fedora based container with DHCPD and webmin

Heavily borrowed from sameersbn/docker-bind

This is a Fedora based DHCP server with webmin to run as a docker container.

Webmin is not fully functioning att his stage due to the systemctl not being available.  Hopefully this will be fixed soon.
